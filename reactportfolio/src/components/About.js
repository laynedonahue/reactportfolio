  <h1>Hello, thank you for viewing my portfolio.</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Layne Donahue, I am a full stack web developer from Upstate New York.  Recently, I made the move to Los Angeles in search of better opportunities for work.
    With each day, I grow and learn as a person and developer.  I believe that no task is below me or too great for me, as everything in life is a learning opportunity.
    I plan to continue to grow and become a better developer.
